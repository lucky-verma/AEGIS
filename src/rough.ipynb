These activities are managed and coordinated by multinational corporations MNCs via investment, trade, people, technology, and information flows. Their business decisions have profound implications for the global economy. It is impossible to understand GVCs without understanding how MNCs make their global production decisions. By understanding the objectives and strategies of MNCs, developing countries can better stimulate their entry into GVCs and increase the development benefits from MNC activities in their economies. MNCs have proliferated since the 1970s. They and their affiliates contributed 36 percent of global output in 2016, including around two-thirds of global exports and more than half of imports. Countries that are major global exporters all benefit from a strong pres- ence of MNCs. Three objectives dominate the production decisions of MNCs lowering production costs, mitigating risks, and increasing market power.',\n",

As a state agency, DHS adheres to the State of Georgia Procurement Manual issued by the Department of Administrative Services DOAS. Per the State of Georgia Procurement Manual, State entities should utilize competitively bid contracts to the extent feasible. State purchasing regulations require State entities to publicly advertise solicitations using the Georgia Procurement Registry GPR. The GPR is a public listing of solicitations posted by Georgia government entities. Additionally, the Georgia Procurement Manual notes that the existence of emergency situations creates an urgent need for supplies or services that may not be met through the normal procurement process. If an emergency purchase requires prompt but not immediate action, the State Entity should, to the extent possible given the circumstances of such an emergency, contact multiple suppliers and solicit informal quotes. In the event of an emergency purchase, State entities must provide DOAS with written notice and justification by completing form SPD- NI004 Emergency Justification Form.',\n",

The 787 Dreamliner project finally finished in September 2011, three years later than originally planned and with much higher costs. A corporate culture centered on cost cutting coupled with technical miscalculations and man- agement misjudgments eventually culminated in two fatal crashes that killed 346 people in 2018 and 2019.

It laid off experienced engineers and pressed suppliers to cut costs for the software for the 737 Max. Experienced Boeing engineers confirmed that the 737 Max crashes were caused by the outsourcing of some software-development tasks to recent college gradu- ates earning as little as US9 per hour who were employed by an Indian subcontractor Robinson 2019.

Taken together, overreliance on outsourcing and offshoring without sufficient up-front effort to define products and assess costs and risks eventually hurt Boeings prospects and cost hundreds of lives. Supply chain management and risk mitigation Different products and services demand distinct supply chain management practices and risk mitigation measures. In the manufacturing sectors, supply chain manage- ment involves literally moving objects from one place to another. Transportation and warehousing costs are based on the size, weight, perishability, and fragility of goods. Risks arise at every step conceiving of the product, securing raw materials, having parts and components manufactured and delivered on time from multitiered suppli- ers, assembling the product, and storing and shipping it. In service sectors, however, the flow of information matters more.',\n",
